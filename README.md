# SASS Starter

The goal of it is to provide a scalable and production-ready template that can be fully customized to your needs, while still being easy to use and maintain. It also is structured in a modular way, so we can implemented multiple providers for different features (like payments, auth, analytics, etc.) and you can choose features and providers you want to use.

## Principles

- Focus on DX
- Fully typed
- Modular & Extensible
- Fully customizable
- Production-ready
- Scalable
- Serverless
