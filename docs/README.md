## Introduction

supastarter is the ultimate starter template for your SaaS application. It's built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Internationalization

supastarter uses [next-i18next](https://github.com/i18next/next-i18next) for internationalization. It's a great library that allows you to easily add multiple languages to your application.

## Storybook

supastarter uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to develop and document your components. It's a great tool that allows you to develop and test your components in isolation.
